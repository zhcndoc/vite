It allows running any code by processing it with Vite plugins first. It is different from <code>server.ssrLoadModule</code> because the runtime implementation is decoupled from the server. This lets library and framework authors implement their own layer of communication between the server and the runtime. This new API is intended to replace Vite&#39;s current SSR primitives once it is stable.</p><p>The new API brings many benefits:</p><ul><li>Support for HMR during SSR.</li><li>It is decoupled from the server, so there is no limit on how many clients can use a single server - every client has its own module cache (you can even communicate with it how you want - using message channel/fetch call/direct function call/websocket).</li><li>It doesn&#39;t depend on any node/bun/deno built-in APIs, so it can run in any environment.</li><li>It&#39;s easy to integrate with tools that have their own mechanism to run code (you can provide a runner to use <code>eval</code> instead of <code>new AsyncFunction</code> for example).</li></ul><p>The initial idea <a href="https://github.com/nuxt/vite/pull/201" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">was proposed by Pooya Parsa</a> and implemented by <a href="https://github.com/antfu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Anthony Fu</a> as the <a href="https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/tree/main/packages/vite-node#readme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">vite-node</a> package to <a href="https://antfu.me/posts/dev-ssr-on-nuxt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">power Nuxt 3 Dev SSR</a> and later also used as the base for <a href="https://vitest.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vitest</a>. So the general idea of vite-node has been battle-tested for quite some time now. This is a new iteration of the API by <a href="https://github.com/sheremet-va" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vladimir Sheremet</a>, who had already re-implemented vite-node in Vitest and took the learnings to make the API even more powerful and flexible when adding it to Vite Core.

This is now relaxed to allow HMR to apply without a full page reload, but if any error happens during HMR, the page will be reloaded.

This new option can be used to force externalize all packages including linked packages too. This is handy in tests within monorepos where we want to emulate the usual case of all packages externalized, or when using <code>ssrLoadModule</code> to load an arbitrary file and we want to always external packages as we don&#39;t care about HMR.

We measured the loading time for 10K modules (25 level deep tree) using <a href="https://github.com/yyx990803/vite-dev-server-perf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">vite-dev-server-perf</a> for all minor versions from Vite 4.0. This is a good benchmark to measure the effect of Vite&#39;s bundle-less approach. Each module is a small TypeScript file with a counter and imports to other files in the tree, so this mostly measuring the time it takes to do the requests a separate modules. In Vite 4.0, loading 10K modules took 8 seconds on a M1 MAX. We had a breakthrough in <a href="./announcing-vite4-3.html">Vite 4.3 were we focused on performance</a>, and we were able to load them in 6.35 seconds. In Vite 5.1, we managed to do another performance leap.

With Rollup 4 switching its parser to native, and Rolldown being worked on, both the performance and the dev-vs-build inconsistency story for this feature are no longer valid. We want to continue improving dev/build consistency, and have concluded that using Rolldown for &quot;prebundling during dev&quot; and &quot;production builds&quot; is the better bet moving forward. Rolldown may also implement caching in a way that is a lot more efficient during build than deps prebundling.
